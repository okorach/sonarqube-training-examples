Several examples of analysis that demonstrate different use cases

* Complexity: Demonstrate difference between cyclomatic and cognitive complexity

* Coverage: Demonstrate the calculations for line, condition and overall coverage

* Size metrics: Demonstrate the calculation of different size metrics (lines, loc, lines to cover, comment lines and comments %)

* Metrics-without-scm: Demonstrate the 7.1+ ability to compute metrics on new code even without SCM
